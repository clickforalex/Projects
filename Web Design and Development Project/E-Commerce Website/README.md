# Web Design and Development Project

This project was done by me during my 2nd Year in Nanyang Polytechnic as a Infocom and Media Engineering Student.
I created a mock e-commerce website to simulate the following:
  - Signup, Login, Logout
  - Admin Accounts are able to add, edit, and delete items in the e-commerce website
  - Customer User accounts are able to
    - Add items to cart
    - Add and Substract Quantity in cart
    - Remove Item from cart
    - Edit Profile Picture, Change Password and Email
    - Make purchases, assign date of Delivery, and View Order History, Cancelled Orders and Successful Orders
  - Added Items, Accounts created, and Data edited will be updated into SQL Database
  - Admin Accounts have extra features such as adding items to the website category while Customer user accounts don't
