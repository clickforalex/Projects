# Web Design and Development Project

During my second year at Nanyang Polytechnic in 2022, as a student studying Infocom and Media Engineering, I undertook a project involving the development of a simulated e-commerce website. The key functionalities of this project included:

- Implementation of Signup, Login, and Logout features.
 - Provision for Admin Accounts to manage items by adding, editing, or deleting them     from the e-commerce platform.
 - Functionality for Customer User accounts to:
 - Add items to their cart.
 - Adjust item quantities within the cart (addition and subtraction).
 - Remove items from the cart.
 - Modify profile picture, change passwords, and update email addresses.
 - Conduct purchases, set delivery dates, and access Order History encompassing both     cancelled and successful orders.
- All additions of items, account creations, and data modifications were         
  systematically updated in an SQL Database.
- Admin Accounts were endowed with additional privileges, including the ability to      categorize items on the website, a feature not available to Customer User accounts.
